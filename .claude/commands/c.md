# Codebase Analysis

Explore and analyze this codebase to understand:

1. **Project Structure**: What is the overall architecture and folder organization?
2. **Technology Stack**: What frameworks, libraries, and technologies are being used?
3. **Core Functionality**: What does this application do? What are its main features?
4. **Entry Points**: Where does the application start? (e.g., main files, pages, routes)
5. **Key Components**: What are the most important files and modules?
6. **Dependencies**: What external packages or services does it rely on?
7. **Configuration**: How is the app configured? (environment variables, config files, etc.)

Start by examining package.json, README files, main entry points, and key directories. Provide a clear, concise summary of your findings.
